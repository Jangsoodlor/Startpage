## Set Startpage As New Tab Page <a name="set-startpage"></a>
### ðŸ”¨ Build & Sign The Extension
I use `web-ext` to build and sign my startpage extensions, please note that any modifications you make to the startpages won't take effect unless the extension is rebuilt.

ðŸš¨ Please note that this is **not the only way** to set my startpages as a new tab page, it is just the way I do it.

#### Prerequisites
- [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext)

Install from NPM:
```
npm install --global web-ext
```

Got GNU/Linux? It should be available in your distribution's repositories.

#### Building The Extension
In your terminal:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/grtcdr/startpages
```
2. Jump inside the repository:
```
cd startpages
```
3. Navigate inside the __src__ directory of your desired startpage.
Let's use _startpage_7_ as an example:
```
cd startpage_7/src
```
4. Sign the extension
```
web-ext sign --api-key=$AMO_JWT_ISSUER --api-secret=$AMO_JWT_SECRET
```

For more information on how to obtain your `api-key` and `api-secret`, [read this guide by Mozilla.](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/) Signing an extension is talked about under _"Signing your extension for self-distribution"_

If all goes well during the signing process, you will discover that a new directory, `web-ext-artifacts` has appeared, and it contains a `.xpi` file.

5. Open Firefox, type `about:addons` in the search bar and drag & drop the `.xpi` file into the window.
6. Firefox will now prompt you to add the extension, click `Add`

You're good to go, the startpage will now appear every time you open up a new tab page.
