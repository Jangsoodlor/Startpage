## What is this?
This is a startpage that I am using currently for a year now. Forked from [grtcdr/linen](https://github.com/grtcdr/linen) with few customizations, Mainly the Dracula theme.

## Main Features

- Quick access to your favorite websites
## Customization

Maybe you want to change the links? 
- They're inside `index.html`

Want your username to display next to the greeting?
- It's inside `script.js`

Want to change color pallettes?
- Go inside `style.css`

## Set Startpage As New Tab Page <a name="set-startpage"></a>
Coming Soon....
